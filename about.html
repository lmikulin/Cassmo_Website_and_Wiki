        <h3>What is Cassmo?</h3>

        <div class="section" id="game">
            <h4>The Game</h4>
            <p>The game is some space thing</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="goal">
            <h4>Our Goal</h4>
            <p>To make a game</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="genre">
            <h4>MMORPGRTS Command Simulation</h4>
            <p>MMORPGRTS Command Simulation, or Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Real Time Strategy Command Simulation. It is the genre of game we have chosen for ourselves, but it is basically meaningless. The point we wanted to get across is the freedom that Cassmo offers, you can approach a situation in anyway, using a multitude of tactics that may borrow from any genre of game, not just one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="world">
            <h4>The World</h4>
            <p>The Universe of Cassmo takes place across the entire Milky Way galaxy. It takes place thousand of years in our future. See the lore section of the Wiki if you want a more detailed description.</p>

        <div class="section" id="cas">
            <h4>CAS and IB</h4>
            <p>This game was created for the CAS portion of the IB program. The creators are currently enrolled in the IB (International Baccalaureate) program, and one of the requirements of completion is to finish CAS. CAS stands for Creative Action Service, and these in turn are the categories that we must complete. In the CAS program you are required to complete a project that takes over a year to complete, and covers AT LEAST two of the categories. This game is that project. It covers the Creative portion, because we are creating something, and the Service portion, because our <a href="documentation.html">Documentation</a> section provides tutorials and information for those wishing to do a similar thing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="credit">
            <h4>Credits</h4>
            <p>This game was created by Eric Mikulin, Peter Fajner and Troy Hill. <br>With help from these fine fellows: NOBODY YET. <br>The website was created by Eric Mikulin <br>The server-side software was created by Peter Fajner</p>
